# Prioritize
A module which generates every possible string which could be composed from one or more substrings (called priorities), and yields those results optimized such that each permutation of the string containing a given list of priorities is yielded before any permutations containing lower priorities. Combinations  with replacements of the priorties are optimized such that combinations with less replacements are yielded before more replacements, so shorter strings closer matching the original priorities are considered higher priority than longer strings with multiple occuraces of one ore more priorities.

## Usage
```python
from prioritize import prioritized_permutations

priorities = ["1st priority", "2nd priority", "3rd", "..."]
MIN_STRING_LENGTH = 4
MAX_STRING_LENGTH = 12
for result in prioritized_permutations(priorities,MIN_STRING_LENGTH,MAX_STRING_LENGTH):
    print(result)
```

See [testing_scratch_pad.py](/testing_scratch_pad.py) for other usage examples.

## Documentation and Resources
Generates strings for each multiset permutation for each possible combination (with replacement, that would result in a string of length within the min and max length specified) of a given set of priorities, in order of their priority. Order of priority is determined by the order of the priorities provided. This order is similar to, but not the same as lexigraphical order. It is optimized such that any version of a string containing a given set of priorities will be yielded before a string containing lower priorities. Permutations for a given combination are returned with the highest priorities occuring in the
string first. Combinations with n replacements of equal sets of priorities are returned with n increasing.
**TODO:** Need to find out what that kind of ordering is called...

Duplicate values may be generated but will not be returned. Duplicates are only generated when a priority can be formed from a combination of one or more lower priorities.

Duplicates are prevented from being returned by determining what the highest priorities are the current string could be made from and checking if the priorities used to generate the current string match. This has the benefit of not requiring a recording of which strings have already been generated.
**TODO:** Make the algorithm check if duplicates are possible before checking for them

The original intended application was to generate a stream of prioritized strings for password crackers. This means when testing every possible variant of a password, a complete word list does not need to be generated, stored, and sorted in order to optimize which passwords are tested first.  The function can immediatly begin streaming the strings to test, saving space and time.
